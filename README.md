## How to run

##### IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

It is recommended to run the _XeresApplication_ Spring Boot configuration which is the most convenient and fastest way.  
Just make sure to configure it in the following way:

Select _Edit Configurations..._ of the _XeresApplication_ Spring Boot configuration.

Put the following _VM options_:

    -ea -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

And the following _Active profiles_:

    dev

Optionally, for faster build/test turnarounds you can add in the _program arguments_:

	--fast-shutdown

Then just run the _XeresApplication_ Spring Boot configuration.

##### IntelliJ Community Edition

Run the Gradle ``bootRun`` target. It's in the top right _Gradle_ panel, Tasks / application. It's already preconfigured.

(This way also works with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, but you'll miss some extras like colored debug output and faster launch)

##### Command line

###### Windows

	gradlew.bat bootRun

###### Linux

	./gradlew bootRun

To pass Xeres arguments, just use the args feature, for example:

	./gradlew bootRun --args="--no-gui --fast-shutdown"

(Use ``--help`` to know all arguments)

## How to set up the WebUI

_Note: the webui is currently nonfunctional._

Run the gradle tasks ``installAngular`` (if you don't already have Angular installed) then ``buildAngular``. The later will create the needed files that will be served by Xeres on ``localhost:1066``.

## Database debugging

With IntelliJ Ultimate, create the following Database connection with the built-in Datagrip client (aka the _Database_ tool window)

- Connection type: Embedded
- Driver: H2
- Path: select ``./data/userdata.mv.db``. If the file is not there, run Xeres once.
- Authentication: User & Password
- User: ``sa``
- There's no password

## Run tests locally

With IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, setup the following JUnit Configuration:
- add VM options: -ea -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
- All in packages: io.xeres
- Working directory: put a **real** working directory (the default won't work if you want code coverage)
- Search for tests: in whole project

## Misc

The project was started on 2019-10-30.

##### Git branching model

The current plan is to use *master* for everything. Use a feature branch to work on a feature (for example, feature/165-the-feature (165 would be the ticket number, if any)). Once it's ready, have someone review it then merge to master.

Releases will use tags and release branches if further fixes are needed.

## Useful Gradle tasks

##### Cleaning the build directory

run the ``clean`` task

##### Cleaning the Angular generated directory

run the ``cleanAngular`` task

##### Upgrading Gradle

- change the version in _build.gradle_ in the _wrapper_ section
- run the ``wrapper`` task

## Manual testing

##### Using multiple configs

Node A:
	--data-dir=./data2 --control-port=1068

Node B:
	--data-dir=./data3 --control-port=1069
