## Development

### Build Requirements

- Java 21

If you want to quickly try the current development version without installing anything else, see the [command line](#command-line) section below.

### How to run

##### IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

Run the _XeresApplication_ Spring Boot configuration.

- Active Profile: `dev`
- VM Options: `-ea -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8`
- CLI arguments: `--fast-shutdown`

##### IntelliJ Community Edition

Run the Gradle ``bootRun`` target. It's in the top right _Gradle_ panel, Tasks / application. It's already preconfigured.

(This way also works with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, but you'll miss some extras like colored debug output and faster launch)

##### Command Line

###### Windows

	gradlew.bat bootRun

###### Linux

	./gradlew bootRun

To pass arguments to Xeres, just use the args feature, for example:

	./gradlew bootRun --args="--no-gui --fast-shutdown"

(Use ``--help`` to know all arguments)

### Database Debugging

#### Online

When running Xeres with the `dev` profile, there's a built-in H2 Console available, accessible through the _Debug_ menu.

#### Offline

With IntelliJ Ultimate, create the following Database connection with the built-in Datagrip client (aka the _Database_ tool window)

- Connection type: Embedded
- Driver: H2
- Path: select ``./data/userdata.mv.db``. If the file is not there, run Xeres once.
- Authentication: User & Password
- User: ``sa``
- There's no password

You can also download the [H2 installer](https://www.h2database.com/html/download.html) (version to use: 2.1.214).
Then run the H2 console with the following settings:

- Saved Settings: Generic H2 (Embedded)
- Driver Class: org.h2.Driver
- JDBC URL: `hdbc:h2:file:~/workspace/Xeres/data/userdata` (put your path, and no file extension at the end!)
- User Name: sa
- The password is empty

### Useful Gradle Tasks

##### Running Tests Locally

run the ``test`` task

##### Cleaning the Build Directory

run the ``clean`` task

##### Upgrading Gradle

- change the version in _build.gradle_ in the _wrapper_ section
- run the ``wrapper`` task

### Useful Links

##### Pick a FontAwesome Icon

https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/

Replace all '-' by '_' in their names for use in JavaFX.

### Git Branching Model

*master* always contains the current and runnable code. Use a feature branch to work on a feature (for example, feature/165-the-feature (165 would be the ticket number, if any)). Once it's ready, have someone review it then merge to master.

Releases use tags and might use a release branches if urgent fixes are needed.

### Manual Testing

##### Using Multiple Configs

Pass the following arguments to run multiple instances.

Location A:

	--data-dir=./data2

Location B:

	--data-dir=./data3

### Monitoring

When running Xeres with the `dev` profile, JMX monitoring is available either using JConsole or [VisualVM](https://visualvm.github.io/).
Simply run them and connect to the Xeres session.
