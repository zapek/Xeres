# Connections

The connection with other friends happens automatically as long as you added them before in the [Quick Setup](01.Quick%20Setup.md) section.

Xeres automatically takes care of finding the peers and connecting to them. It can take a little while, from a few seconds to a couple of minutes.

Remember you both need to have added each other's ID, otherwise it won't work.

The number of connected friends is displayed on the lower left of the main window as well. There's also a DHT and NAT indicator whose function is described below.

## Troubleshooting

### DHT

DHT means Distributed Hash Table and is a system that helps two peers find each other when their IP address has changed or is unknown. If the LED is not green, then connecting to friends might be more difficult.

### NAT

If you're behind a NAT (Network Address Translation: most routers are configured with a NAT), then incoming connections might be restricted. Xeres tries to get around this by using the UPNP protocol. Make sure UPNP is enabled on your router. Contrary to popular beliefs, UPNP is secure nowadays as all old bugs have been
ironed out. The NAT LED in Xeres should be green.
